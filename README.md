# Virtual-world
 
 This is a virtual world built up with alerts and prompts in javascript. it is case sensetive so you haveto answer the questions with the alternatives that you get with a big letter. for example would you like to fight this bandits? Yes or No. Here you answer either Yes or No.
 At the start of the game you get to pick gender so make sure to pick a gender or else the game will exit itself if wrong option is picked. Note that this is like the whole world itself Case sensetive.
